I made this since my dad loves Blokus ... maybe more than he loves me, just kidding

Assuming previous knowledge on how to play Blokus.
Order of play is as follows: Blue starts in top left corner, then yellow in top right, then red in bottom right, then green in bottom left, and back to blue...
To place a piece, pick the individual squares the piece occupies on the board, then press on the piece in the collection on the left to lock it in.
If the move is legal, the piece will dissapear from the collection and lock into the board, and it will be the next color's turn. Continue until there are no moves left. 
If you have no moves left, click the button and the game with skip your turn.
